# Crystals Collector

https://mdsw81.github.io/CrystalsCollector/

There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
  The game hides this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
  When the player does click one, the game updates the player's score counter.
The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player sees a new random number. 
All the crystals will have four new hidden values.
The user's score and score counter will resets to zero.

The game shows the number of games the player wins and loses.
